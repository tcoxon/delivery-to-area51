# Delivery to Area 51

Four months after Christmas, Santa is watching the annual penguin battle royale, enjoying a beer on his sofa, when he discovers a missing Christmas list crumpled up between the cushions on his sofa! He's late delivering a present! But the address is inside Area 51... How on earth will he get in?

Delivery to Area 51 tells the tale of Santa's mission to break into the famously secret military base Area 51, to deliver a present. Along the way he cracks skulls, meets old friends, and picks up a mind-control gun.

Christmas is coming, bitches!
